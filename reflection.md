I talked with my friend Lilliana and went to TA hours where I talked with Lan, Zihan, and Ashley. I went on Tuesday from 7pm - 9pm. I was really struggling with the assignment, because I kept getting tripped up with the way Java is formatted. A lot of things are similar with Python, but there are enough differences that coding in Java gave me challenges. For loops and if/else statements work the same, but I had trouble formatting them. Scanners and saving the user's response to an object was difficult. I also had trouble differentiating when to use lits or when to use arrays. I kept getting errors when I tried making them. Overall, the formatting and converting things found in Python to Java gave me difficulties. For advice, I would suggest starting this assignment earlier. I thought I gave myself enough time to finish this homework, but I needed more help than I anticipated.
